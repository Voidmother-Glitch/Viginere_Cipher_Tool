# Viginere_Cipher_Tool
Vigenère Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool, written in Python. Fully run on local machine. No data sent to any party.

In red-teaming, it's helpful to encode messages sometimes, be it for covert communication, encrypted data exfiltration, or prompt injection. 
The process of decoding instructions makes the application of LLM constraints and guardrails significantly less effective.
I threw this together so I could quickly use a Vigenère Cipher without relying on an online tool. 
No shade to the creators of those online tools. I just don't want to send client data across a network or out to the web if I don't have to! :)
